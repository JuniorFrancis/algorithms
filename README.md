A repository where i place my studies on algorithms! 


1 - InsertionSort
Algorithm where's the sort it's made by a comparison one by one in a array. 
The number where we are going to sort is stored in a var and after this we make a comparasion one by one in the array.
And after this we make a comparasion one by one in the array using a While. 
While the loop is acept, the substituition its make and at the end, the var stored in de begin its used for replace in its place.

Your complexity is O(n + f(n)) because as there is a for and a while (two loops) and every complete while need only one for loop (While nested to a for).

To improve the performance of the algorithm we can use Linked List ( Soon )
